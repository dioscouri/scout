SCOUT is an Activity Logger for Joomla from the crew behind TIENDA, JUGA, BILLETS, and SYNK.

Scout tracks all the activity on your Joomla site that you specify. It tracks activity by using normal Joomla plugins, which can be enabled/disabled at will.

For example, if you wanted to track the activity in the Core Content Manager, you'd just enabled the SCOUT Content Plugin. Then, in your SCOUT logs, you'd see WHO acted on WHAT content article WHEN.

Features:
----------
* Activity logging for both the front-end and the admin-side.
* Track activity in all Nooku-powered extensions
* Admin-side module that displays last x log entries
* Admin-side report for browsing & searching all admin-side activity

We use SCOUT on Dioscouri.com, so it is actively used and bug tested by us. However, you should still report bugs and feature requests to us, because we want to know what integrations you need! What activity do you want tracked? Only with your participation can SCOUT become exactly what you need.
